I worked on the Bittiliiga Platform first at Bittiliiga ry and eventually at Gamers Unite oy. Initially my work included purely front-end jobs, refurbishing the look and feel of the platform. At Bittiliiga ry I was solely responsible for both the UI and UX design and implementation. Some of my work was closer to the back-end, directly working with our MongoDB database when creating new components for the platform.
