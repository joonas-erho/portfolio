I worked on the Bittiliiga Platform first at Bittiliiga ry and eventually at Gamers Unite oy. Initially my work included purely front-end jobs, refurbishing the look and feel of the platform. At Bittiliiga ry I was solely responsible for both the UI and UX design and implementation. 
</p>
<p>
In addition to working with the visual style of the platform, some of my work was closer to the back-end, directly working with our MongoDB database or various external systems when creating new components for the platform. For example, I created a system to write and release news that would be relayed through Prismic to users both on the platform and on the Bittiliiga website (shown below).

The Bittiliiga website was my first professional solo project. Much like with the platform, the front-end was implemented with Vue and Nuxt. In addition to showing static information, the website showed the latest news and played matches on the platform live.

</p>
A Discord bot that bridged the Bittiliiga gaming platform to its Discord server. Implemented with Node and Discord.js, the bot's main feature was to check if users logging onto the Discord server have connected their Discord account to their Bittiliiga account. It also managed roles on the server and could be used by users to ask for help or report unwanted activity.
