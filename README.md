# Portfolio
A portfolio of my coding projects that are not otherwise found on my GitHub account.

_WIP_

## Bittiliiga Platform
_Worked on 2019-2021_<br>
I worked on the Bittiliiga Platform first at Bittiliiga ry and eventually at Gamers Unite oy. Initially my work included purely front-end jobs, refurbishing the look and feel of the platform. At Bittiliiga ry I was solely responsible for both the UI and UX design and implementation. Eventually my work slid more towards the back-end, directly working with our MongoDB database when creating new components for the platform.
